As Charleston Community Church comes together to worship, learn, and grow, there are several ways individuals can contribute to the church's mission. These avenues of support encompass Prayerful, Practical, and Financial contributions, each playing a crucial role in sustaining God's work in Charleston.

**Prayerful Support:**

Prayer is the driving force that underpins all endeavors of the church. Believers are encouraged to lift up their voices in prayer for the church's leaders, members, and visitors. Our Minister [Andy Robertson](https://bonartrust.org/training-churches), [Rachel Baker](https://20schemesequip.com/multi_author/rachel-parentau/), Gospel Worker (from 20schemes), Caireen leading Wee Rascals, Ann heading up the Senior's Lunch, Bev and Rachel - Ladies' Bible Study Leaders, the Elders, the musicians, and numerous other church members and regular attenders that contribute to the life of the church. When people pray they actively participate in supporting our small congregation. 

Until we are able to get the resources to write and distribute our own prayer and news letter, please feel free to subscribe to the [Free Church of Scotland Prayer Notes](https://freechurch.org/prayer/) that inform us of the local prayer needs (sent weekly to your email inbox). 

**Practical Support:**

Rolling up one's sleeves to support the church's initiatives is another impactful way to contribute. Charleston Community Church provides numerous opportunities for hands-on involvement. Mission work allows individuals to spread the message of faith through action, while assisting in organizing events such as holiday clubs in the summer.

Simple acts like serving tea and coffee before services contribute to a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making visitors and members feel valued and cherished. Other ways to serve are to volunteer to read the Bible passages on Sunday, help out at the Impact club as a leader, volunteer in the crèche, operating the sound board, and most importantly welcoming visitors and usuals alike at the café and church.  Matthew 20:26-28 "Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave — just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

**Financial Giving:**

Financial support is much appreciated to aid the church's ongoing activities and initiatives. Charleston Community Church gratefully welcomes any financial contributions that individuals or other churches are willing to offer. Donations can be made via cheques or electronic transfers using the provided account details: **Sort Code 80-73-31, Account Number 06038175, payable to Charleston Church Plant.** For those who are taxpayers in the UK, filling out this [Gift Aid Form](GiftAid-Form-Charleston.pdf) can lead to an extra 25 pence for every pound donated, maximizing the impact of one's generosity.  You can support Rachel through the [20schemes](https://20schemes.infoodle.com/f/OnlineDonationsFormInternationalWorkers) ministry.

Many thanks for your support in any form for God's work through Charleston Community Church!
