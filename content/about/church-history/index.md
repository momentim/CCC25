## **Pre-Christian Influences (c. 200–400 AD)**

Before the arrival of Christianity, Scotland was a land of many **pagan traditions**. The **Pictish** and **Brittonic tribes** practiced religions deeply rooted in **Celtic druidism**, with its emphasis on **nature worship** and **ritual**. The **Roman occupation** of southern Scotland, particularly in regions like the **Borders** and **Lothian**, introduced elements of **Roman paganism**, but evidence of a significant Christian presence during this period is scarce. While some scholars suggest that **Roman soldiers** or **traders** may have brought Christian ideas to the region, these early influences were likely limited and did not take root on a large scale. The Christian population during this time was small, estimated at a few hundred to a few thousand, mainly among Roman soldiers and traders, representing **less than 1%** of the population.

## **Early Christian Missionaries (400–600 AD)**

The **Christianisation of Scotland** began in earnest with the arrival of missionaries in the **5th** and **6th centuries**. **St. Ninian**, traditionally credited with bringing Christianity to the Picts, founded **Whithorn (Candida Casa)** around **397 AD**, establishing the earliest recorded Christian site in Scotland. A few centuries later, **St. Columba**, an Irish monk, arrived in **563 AD** and founded the renowned monastery on the island of **Iona**. This monastery became a hub for **evangelism**, particularly among the **Picts** and **Scots**. During this period, the **Celtic Church** emerged, characterised by its **monastic** and **decentralised structure**. It developed distinct practices, such as a unique calculation for **Easter** and a specific style of **tonsure**, setting it apart from the **Roman Church**. By this time, the Christian population had grown to an estimated **10,000–50,000**, representing **5–10%** of the population, mostly concentrated in southern Scotland and the **Hebrides**.

Christianity influenced early Scottish society by promoting **literacy**, as monks began to copy and preserve manuscripts, ensuring the transmission of knowledge. Monasteries like **Iona** and **Whithorn** became centres of learning, where not only religious but also **legal** and **historical texts** were maintained. Christian ethics introduced new ideas about **justice**, **charity**, and **governance**, setting the foundation for future laws and policies.

---

## **Christianisation of the Picts and Scots (600–800 AD)**

The **7th** and **8th centuries** saw the gradual Christianisation of Scotland’s tribes. **King Nechtan**, a Pictish ruler in the early **700s**, played a pivotal role by adopting **Roman Christian practices**, aligning Scottish Christianity with the broader **Western Church**. The influence of the **Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria** also spread into southern Scotland, with the monastery at **Lindisfarne** serving as a key centre of Christian learning and mission. The **Synod of Whitby (664 AD)**, though primarily an English event, further solidified the shift toward **Roman Christianity** over **Celtic traditions**, influencing the direction of the Scottish Church. By this period, the Christian population had grown significantly to an estimated **100,000–300,000**, representing **30–50%** of the population, with conversion accelerating among the **Picts** and **Scots**.

Christian values increasingly influenced **governance** and **justice**, with Christian kings ruling according to **moral** and **religious principles**. Laws began incorporating Christian ethics, such as the protection of the **poor** and the regulation of **marriage** and **family life** based on biblical teachings. Christian leaders played key advisory roles in royal courts, ensuring the church’s influence on national decision-making.

## **The Viking Raids and Monastic Decline (800–1000 AD)**

The late **8th century** brought a wave of **Viking raids**, which devastated many of Scotland’s monastic centres, including **Iona** in **806 AD**. Monks fled to **Kells** in Ireland, leading to a decline in monastic influence. However, this period also saw the rise of **local kingships**, culminating in the formation of the **Kingdom of Alba** around **900 AD** under **Constantine II**. This political consolidation helped integrate Christianity more firmly into the Scottish state. By the year **1000 AD**, the church was transitioning from a **monastic-based system** to a **parish-based structure**, laying the groundwork for medieval church organisation. Despite the disruptions caused by Viking incursions, the Christian population continued to grow, reaching an estimated **250,000–500,000**, or **50–70%** of the population.

During this time, Christian values shaped Scotland’s emerging **national identity**, providing a sense of unity in the face of external threats. Kings increasingly sought the church’s approval to **legitimise their rule**, reinforcing the idea that governance was ordained by **God**. Christian monasteries also played a crucial role in supporting the poor, providing **food**, **shelter**, and basic **medical care**.

---

## **Early Medieval Church Reforms (1000–1100 AD)**

The **11th century** marked a period of significant reform within the Scottish Church. **Queen Margaret of Scotland - St. Margaret**, played a central role in aligning the Scottish Church more closely with **Roman Catholicism**. She promoted **Sabbath observance**, the Roman method of calculating **Easter**, and **liturgical reforms**. Under her influence, **Benedictine monasteries** were established, including **Dunfermline Abbey**. This era also saw the transition from the older, monastic-based **Celtic Church** to a more structured **diocesan system**, with power shifting from **abbots** to **bishops** appointed by the monarchy. By this time, Christianity was dominant in most of Scotland, with an estimated Christian population of **500,000–700,000**, representing **80–90%** of the population.

Queen Margaret’s reforms also extended to **social welfare**, as she worked to eliminate corrupt practices, improve the status of **women**, and promote **charity** and **education**. She personally fed **orphans** and the **poor**, and her influence ensured that Christian values of **compassion** and **justice** shaped Scotland’s emerging laws and customs.

## **Norman Influence and the Establishment of the Medieval Church (1100–1200 AD)**

The **12th century** brought profound changes under **King David I**, whose reign (**1124–1153**) is often referred to as the **"Davidian Revolution"**. David expanded the **diocesan structure**, creating bishoprics in **Glasgow**, **St. Andrews**, **Dunkeld**, **Moray**, **Aberdeen**, and **Argyll**, reinforcing the role of the Church as a **unifying institution** across Scotland. He also introduced **Norman** and **Anglo-French clergy**, encouraging the establishment of **Augustinian**, **Benedictine**, and **Cistercian monastic orders**, which played a crucial role in **education**, **healthcare**, and **agriculture**.

Monasteries such as **Melrose**, **Holyrood**, **Jedburgh**, and **Kelso** became centres of learning, preserving manuscripts and promoting **literacy** among the nobility and clergy. The Christian ethic of **charity** led to the founding of **hospitals** and **hospices**, which provided care for the sick and poor. The Scottish Church’s relationship with the **Papacy** strengthened, culminating in **Pope Celestine III** recognizing its independence from the Archbishop of York in **1192**, reinforcing a unique **Scottish ecclesiastical identity**. By this time, the Christian population had grown to an estimated **700,000–900,000**, representing **90–95%** of the population.

## **The High Medieval Church and Wars of Independence (1200–1300 AD)**

The **13th century** saw the Scottish Church expand its influence through **parish churches**, **pilgrimage sites**, and the development of **canon law** that governed social and moral life. The arrival of **Dominicans (Blackfriars)** and **Franciscans (Greyfriars)** strengthened the Church’s presence in urban areas, with a focus on **education** and caring for the poor. **Cathedrals** and churches became centres of communal life, hosting town meetings and serving as places of refuge during conflicts.

The **Wars of Independence (1296–1328)** deeply affected church institutions, with monasteries looted and clergy targeted by English forces. Yet, the Church played a crucial role in rallying **national unity**, with bishops and abbots supporting resistance efforts. The **Declaration of Arbroath (1320)**, sent to **Pope John XXII**, asserted Scotland’s independence and made a **theological case** for the legitimacy of Scottish kingship, emphasizing that rulers were accountable to **God**, not just to earthly powers. **Robert the Bruce** further promoted Scottish clergy, securing the bishopric of **St. Andrews** as a key national institution. By this period, Scotland was nearly fully Christian, with an estimated population of **900,000–1,000,000**, representing nearly **100%** of the population.

## **The Late Medieval Church and Early Reform Movements (1300–1400 AD)**

By the **14th century**, the Scottish Church had grown **wealthy** and **powerful**, leading to tensions with the Papacy and calls for reform. Religious institutions played a key role in **local governance**, **education**, and **social welfare**, operating hospitals and schools. However, increasing **corruption**, **nepotism**, and **absenteeism** among clergy led to growing dissatisfaction.

The ideas of **John Wycliffe**, whose followers (the **Lollards**) criticized the Church’s material excesses, began influencing Scottish thought. The **Scottish Parliament** condemned heresy in **1425**, but reformist ideas continued to spread, laying the groundwork for later religious upheaval. Despite internal tensions, the Church remained central to Scottish society, shaping **moral values** and influencing laws on **marriage**, **contracts**, and **justice**. The Christian population remained high, estimated at **1,000,000–1,200,000**, or nearly **100%** of the population.

---

## **The Protestant Reformation and Fall of Catholicism (1500–1560)**

The **16th century** saw seismic religious change, as **Renaissance humanism**, coupled with the teachings of **Martin Luther** and **John Calvin**, ignited a wave of reform. Key figures like **Patrick Hamilton** and **George Wishart** were martyred for advocating **Protestant beliefs**, catalyzing wider resistance against the Catholic hierarchy.

**John Knox**, influenced by **Calvinist teachings** in Geneva, became the chief architect of the **Scottish Reformation**, advocating for **Presbyterianism**. In **1560**, the **Scottish Parliament** officially abolished Catholicism and established the **Kirk (Church of Scotland)**, rejecting papal authority and adopting a system where local congregations had greater autonomy. This move reshaped Scottish culture, emphasizing **universal education**, as Protestant leaders believed everyone should be able to read the Bible.

By this period, the Christian population was estimated at **1,200,000–1,500,000**, representing nearly **100%** of the population, though now divided between **Catholics** and **Protestants**.

---

## **Presbyterian vs. Episcopalian Struggles (1560–1660)**

The late **16th** and early **17th centuries** saw ongoing struggles between **Presbyterianism** and **Episcopalianism**. **James VI** (later James I of England) sought to impose **Episcopalian governance**, leading to fierce opposition. The **National Covenant (1638)** emerged as a defining moment, asserting the right of Scotland to govern its own church free from royal interference.

These religious struggles influenced **Scottish identity**, **legal systems**, and **governance**, reinforcing a tradition of defiance against external control. During **Oliver Cromwell’s rule**, Presbyterianism became dominant, reinforcing a more **democratic** and **congregational** church structure. The Christian population was estimated at **1,500,000–1,700,000**, representing nearly **100%** of the population, with the majority **Protestant**.

---

## **The Killing Time and the Glorious Revolution (1660–1700)**

The restoration of **Charles II** in **1660** brought renewed persecution of **Covenanters**, radical Presbyterians who resisted royal interference in church affairs. The **“Killing Time” (1680s)** saw many Covenanters executed for their beliefs. However, their steadfastness in faith inspired later movements for **religious freedom** and **civil liberties** in Scotland. Covenanting communities maintained secret field meetings (**conventicles**), fostering a culture of resilience and defiance against tyranny. Their martyrdom became a foundational narrative in **Scottish Presbyterian identity**.

The **Glorious Revolution (1688–1689)** marked a turning point. With the ascension of **William of Orange**, the **Presbyterian Kirk** was permanently restored as Scotland’s national church. This transition ensured that parish churches became centres of both **religious** and **civic life**, influencing moral education, charity, and local governance. **Episcopalianism**, while surviving in the Highlands and among Jacobite supporters, gradually declined in political influence. The Christian population during this period was estimated at **1,700,000–1,900,000**, representing nearly **100%** of the population.

---

## **Presbyterian Dominance and Internal Divisions (1700–1800)**

The **18th century** saw the **Church of Scotland** firmly established as the national church, though internal divisions began to emerge. The **Patronage Act (1712)**, which allowed landowners to appoint ministers, sparked opposition and led to the **First Secession (1733)**. This division reflected deeper tensions over church governance and democratic principles, which later influenced movements for broader **political reform**.

The **Evangelical Revival** of the late 18th century brought renewed religious enthusiasm and missionary efforts. The revival’s emphasis on **personal faith** and **moral discipline** helped shape Scotland’s education system, with many ministers promoting literacy to encourage Bible reading. The rise of **Sunday schools** and **parish schools** reinforced Christian teachings as a core aspect of Scottish identity. **Presbyterian values** also played a role in economic development, emphasizing **hard work**, **honesty**, and **thrift**.

The Christian population during this period was estimated at **1,900,000–2,500,000**, representing nearly **100%** of the population, though internal divisions increased.

## **Disruption and the Free Church of Scotland (1800–1900)**

The **19th century** was marked by the **Disruption of 1843**, when thousands left the Church of Scotland to form the **Free Church of Scotland** over disputes about patronage and church governance. The Free Church emphasized **religious independence** and **grassroots decision-making**, principles that later influenced Scottish democracy and civil liberties.

One of the most tangible contributions of the Free Church was in **education**. Before the state took responsibility for schooling in **1872**, the Free Church established hundreds of schools, ensuring access to education for poor and rural communities. **Missionary work** also expanded, both in Scotland’s urban slums and abroad, reinforcing Scotland’s reputation as a hub for **evangelical outreach**.

Meanwhile, the **Catholic Church** grew in influence due to **Irish immigration**, particularly during the **Great Famine** of the 1840s. Catholic communities established their own schools, charities, and parishes, helping to integrate Irish migrants while maintaining their distinct religious identity.

The Christian population during this period was estimated at **2,500,000–4,000,000**, representing over **95%** of the population, though immigration introduced more religious diversity.

**Robert Murray M’Cheyne (1813–1843)**

Perhaps **Dundee’s** most famous minister, **Robert Murray M’Cheyne** served as pastor of **St. Peter’s Church** from **1836** until his untimely death at the age of **29**. A deeply spiritual preacher, M’Cheyne was known for his **passionate sermons** and deep concern for **holiness**. His legacy endures through his writings, particularly his **Bible reading plan**, still widely used today. M’Cheyne also played a role in early **Jewish mission work**, traveling to **Palestine** in **1839** to explore opportunities for evangelism. His ministry in Dundee sparked revival, and his influence remains strong in evangelical circles.

**Thomas Chalmers (1780–1847)**

As the leader of the **Disruption of 1843**, which led to the formation of the **Free Church of Scotland**, **Thomas Chalmers’** vision and ideas profoundly shaped religious life across Scotland. The Free Church, under his influence, grew rapidly, emphasizing **evangelical preaching**, **social reform**, and a commitment to addressing the spiritual, educational, and material needs of society. Chalmers also advocated for **poor relief reforms**, influencing later social policies that improved care for the destitute.

## **20th Century: Secularisation and Church Decline (1900–2000)**

The **20th century** saw the reunification of some Presbyterian churches, but overall, **church attendance declined** as **secularism** and **liberal theology** gained ground. Despite this decline, Christianity still shaped social values and institutions. The **Church of Scotland** played a key role in establishing **charities**, **hospitals**, and **welfare programs**, often working alongside the government in social reform efforts.

In the early 20th century, many Scots were involved in **Christian socialist movements**, advocating for **workers’ rights** and **economic justice**. The **Temperance movement**, rooted in Presbyterian moral teaching, influenced laws restricting alcohol consumption. Christian organizations also played an important role in **anti-poverty initiatives**, setting up **soup kitchens** and **social missions** in industrial cities.

However, by the late 20th century, Christianity’s influence in public life had significantly waned. The Christian population declined from around **4,000,000 (over 90%)** in **1900** to around **2,500,000 (60%)** by **2000**.

---

## **21st Century: Christianity in a Secular Scotland (2000–Present)**

In the **21st century**, the decline of **mainline churches** has continued, though **Evangelical** and **Charismatic movements** have seen some growth. Despite lower church attendance, Christian organizations continue to have an impact on **charitable work**, **social justice**, and **education**. Many **food banks**, **homeless shelters**, and **addiction recovery programs** in Scotland today are run by churches or Christian groups.

Debates over social issues like **same-sex marriage** and **LGBTQ+ inclusion** have caused further divisions within the **Church of Scotland**, leading some congregations to leave and join more conservative denominations. Meanwhile, **religious pluralism** has increased, with the growth of **Islam**, **Hinduism**, and other faiths due to immigration. **Atheism** and **"no religion"** responses in censuses have also risen, reflecting Scotland’s increasingly secular society.

Despite these changes, Christian communities continue to influence ethics in **healthcare**, **education**, and **humanitarian aid**. Many Scottish Christians remain active in **human rights advocacy**, **anti-trafficking efforts**, and **environmental stewardship**. The Christian population in **2020** was estimated at around **1,500,000**, representing around **30%** of the population, with continuing decline.

## A Brief History of Charleston Community Church

##  **Our Beginnings**

Charleston Community Church traces its roots to a small Bible study group planted by **St. Peter’s Free Church** in Dundee. In 2017, **Andy Robertson**, along with church elders, was commissioned to serve the Charleston community, a neighbourhood of 4,500 people. The church is part of the **Free Church of Scotland**, a Presbyterian denomination that supports churches across Scotland and beyond through shared theology and mission.

##  **Early Days of the Church**

The first Bible study was held on **24th September 2017** in the White Church of Scotland, led by Andy Robertson. This humble gathering laid the foundation for the church’s future. By **April 2018**, the congregation had taken a significant step forward by renovating a new building at 29 Craigowan Road, the site of the old post office. This project, led by **Crawford Mackenzie** and volunteers from St. Peter’s, provided a dedicated space for worship and community engagement.

##  **Establishing a Home**

In **September 2018**, Charleston Community Church officially began meeting in its new home. Despite the challenges of establishing a new church, the congregation remained faithful, and the church continued to grow. A significant milestone was reached on **31st May 2020**, when the first morning service was held in the church building.

##  **A Season of Growth**

As the church grew, space became an issue. To accommodate more people, the congregation moved its 10:30 am Sunday service to the community centre hall on **16th June 2024**. This move allowed for greater attendance and participation in worship, reflecting the church’s commitment to serving the Charleston community.

##  **Our Partnership with 20 Schemes**

Charleston Community Church is part of **20 Schemes**, a church-planting initiative focused on Scotland’s most impoverished communities. The church-planting process in Charleston involves building partnerships with local churches, recruiting indigenous leaders, and living within the community to foster spiritual growth. **20 Schemes** emphasises evangelism, discipleship, and one-to-one Bible study, empowering local leaders to make a lasting impact.

##  **Looking Ahead**

From its humble beginnings as a small Bible study to a growing congregation, Charleston Community Church stands as a testament to God’s faithfulness. As the church continues to serve the Charleston community, it remains committed to sharing the love of Christ and standing firm on His Word.
