### Be Part of Our Church Family Online

Our church is more than just Sundays â€” weâ€™re a community that supports, encourages, and walks through life together all week long.

Weâ€™ve set up a **private Facebook Group** where church members and regulars can:

- Share prayer requests and encouragement
- Stay updated on church events and opportunities
- Chat with others and ask questions
- Connect with folks even if you miss a Sunday

Whether youâ€™re new or have been coming for years, this is a great way to feel more connected.

## ðŸ”’ Private and Safe

The group is **private**, which means only approved members can see the posts. One of our leaders will approve your request to join â€” it only takes a moment.
