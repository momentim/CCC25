### Hope and healing for those facing addiction, trauma, and personal battles.

Welcome to Celebrate Recovery—a Christ-centered, 12-step recovery program for anyone struggling with burdens and addictions.

Join us every **Sunday at 4:30 pm until 5:45 pm** at Charleston Community Church as we support one another in our healing and restoration. Whether you're facing addiction, anxiety, past trauma, or other struggles, this is a safe space to experience God’s grace and support from a caring community.

**About Celebrate Recovery:**
Celebrate Recovery is a biblically based, Christ-centered recovery program that helps individuals overcome life’s challenges through fellowship, accountability, and the power of Jesus Christ. No matter where you are on your journey, you’ll find encouragement and strength through testimonies, learning from the 12 step programme and God's word, and small group discussions.

Each meeting includes a large group session followed by gender-specific small groups, providing a confidential and encouraging atmosphere where you can share and grow. Together, we celebrate victories, support each other in struggles, and embrace the hope and freedom found in Christ.
