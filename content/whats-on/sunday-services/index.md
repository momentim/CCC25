### *“I rejoiced with those who said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the Lord.’”* – Psalm 122:1

At Charleston Community Church, we gather every Sunday to worship God, learn from the Bible, and support one another as we grow in faith. Whether you’ve been part of church life for years or you’re just beginning to explore Christianity, we want you to feel truly welcome.

### 🙌 What to Expect

- **Relaxed & Welcoming Atmosphere** – There’s no dress code and you can sit wherever you feel comfortable. The service is informal and open to all.
- **Worship Through Music** – Our music team leads a mix of traditional hymns, psalms and contemporary songs, with lyrics displayed on-screen.
- **Everyone Together at the Start** – The service begins with all ages together. We sing, pray, and usually have a theme or focus for the day.
- **Children’s Ministry** – After the opening, young children are invited to go to the crèche and older children will be provided with helpful sheets/drawing activities if needed.
- **Bible Teaching** – Each week, our Minister, Andy Robertson, shares a message from the Bible that helps us understand God's word and apply it to everyday life—no prior church experience needed.
- **Prayer & Encouragement** – We spend time praying for one another, our city, and the wider world.

### ✝️ Communion

We share in Communion **6 times per year**, taking time to remember Jesus’ sacrifice, reflect on His love, and celebrate the unity we have in Him. It’s a meaningful part of our year that draws us deeper into our faith and fellowship.

### 💬 Come As You Are

Our hope is to create a space where you can ask questions, meet new friends, and encounter God. Whether you're curious, hurting, searching for purpose, or simply looking for a church to call home—you are welcome here.

We believe the Bible is as relevant today as ever with the best news the world has ever heard and offers real hope and direction for life. Every Sunday is a chance to discover more of what God has to say and how it can change us for the better.
