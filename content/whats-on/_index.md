### We strive to be a church that radiates the love of Christ to all people, demonstrating compassion and extending grace to all regardless of their background.

At Charleston Community Church, we respond to God's boundless love by embracing our neighbors as ourselves. Join our community events—various youth activities, Senior's Lunch, Bible Studies, small groups and more—to deepen your faith, find encouragement, and experience genuine fellowship. Surround yourself with like-minded believers, fostering personal growth, accountability, and a deeper understanding of God's love. Live out your faith authentically, impacting the world through compassion, grace, and the transformative power of the gospel.
