## 📚☕ What to Expect

We meet in the cosy setting of the [**Charleston Community Centre Library**](../../../contact/#charleston-community-centre) for an hour of discussion, reflection, and chat. Each month, we read a different book and gather to talk about what stood out, what made us laugh or cry, and what we learned. 

There’s no pressure to have finished the book or to speak if you’d rather listen. The group is relaxed, informal, and open to all.

And yes — **free tea and coffee** are provided!

## 📖 What Kind of Books Do We Read?

The book list varies, but we aim to include titles that are engaging, thought-provoking, and accessible. Some may explore life, faith, or human experience more deeply, while others might just be a good story that gets us talking.

Book selections will be announced ahead of each meeting, and we’ll make sure they’re easy to find — whether from the library, online, or borrowed from a friend. If you ever need help getting a copy, just let us know.

## 👥 Who Can Come?

Everyone is welcome — simply come and share your joy of reading with others! We especially hope this can be a space where people from different backgrounds can meet, talk, and grow together.

## 💬 How to Join

No need to register — just come along on the first Monday of the month. If you’d like to know what book we’re reading next or want to be added to a mailing list for updates, contact Rachel Baker on our [contact page](../../../contact/#contact-form).
