### There are 2 regular Bible Studies that meet depending on your needs!

Want to know more about the bible, God and the good news of Jesus? Each bible study aims to engage with Scripture, exploring what the passage said to the original readers as well as what it means for us today while getting a chance to connect with each other. Discover the wisdom of the bible, gain practical insights, and strengthen your spiritual foundation.
