<h3>All Ladies' welcome on Tuesdays from 1 - 2pm</h3>

Join our Ladies' Bible Study to get to know more about the Bible, God and the good news of Jesus. Each study we engage with Scripture, exploring what the passage said to the original readers as well as what it means for us today while getting a chance to connect with supportive women. Discover the wisdom of the Bible, gain practical insights, and strengthen your spiritual foundation.

Through discussions, prayer, and shared experiences, we foster an environment for learning and growth. Whether you've never opened the Bible or have read it for years, our study accommodates all levels of knowledge.

**The Ladies' Bible Study meets Tuesdays from 1:00 to 2:00 at the Church.**

Come be empowered alongside other women seeking to deepen their relationship with God and navigate life's difficult storms with a greater sense of peace knowing that the God who governs all things is watching over you. Our Ladies' Bible Study provides a safe space for spiritual nourishment, guidance, and friendship.

Don't miss this opportunity for personal growth. We eagerly await your presence and anticipate God's work in our lives. Email us though our [Contact Page](../../../../contact/#contact-form) with any questions that you have or just join us on Tuesday.
