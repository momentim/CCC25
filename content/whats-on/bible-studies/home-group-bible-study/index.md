### A chance to grow in Bible knowledge, faith and friendship with other believers
Home Group Bible Studies are held on **the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of every month, from 7 to 8pm**. ðŸ“– We come together to have a tea/coffee, prayer and work systematically through a book of the Bible to gain a richer understanding of its teachings and apply them to our lives. Location details will be given via the church whatsapp group.  If you'd like to learn more see any of the elders, Andy, Tim or Phil or email the church office via the [Contact Page](../../../../contact/#contact-form).

The Home Group Bible Study aims to create a warm and inclusive atmosphere, where individuals of all backgrounds and levels of biblical knowledge can engage in open and respectful discussions. Whether you're already a believer or just beginning in the faith, all are welcome! 

We will hold our usual church wide food prayer meeting on the 3rd Wednesday of each month at the church.
