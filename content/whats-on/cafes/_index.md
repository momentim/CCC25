### ☕ We invite you to join us for a beverage and a blether at the various Charleston Community Church Cafés! ☕ 

## [Drop in Café](cafe) is on every Tuesday and Friday at the Church

A drink of tea or coffee is free at every cafe in our newly refurbished premises! We look forward to seeing you soon and why not bring a friend or neighbour.
