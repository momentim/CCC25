<h3>You're Invited to the annual Christmas Carol Service on Thursday the 14th December 2023 at the Charleston Community Centre</h3>
{{< figure src="carolserviceflyer23.png" >}}

<p>Christmas is a time to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, God's son, who showed us God's deep affection for humanity by becoming human himself. The Carol Service reminds us powerfully of Jesus' coming to earth as one of us, showcasing God's love by sharing in our challenges and eventually giving up his life for the sake of all humanity. Jesus's birth, life of love, miracles and teachings and eventual sacrifice is the reason the whole world celebrates at Christmas.</p>

When: **Thursday, 14th December 2023**  
Time: **7:00 pm to 8:00 pm**  
Location: **Charleston Community Centre**, 66 Craigowan Road, Dundee  DD2 4NN
