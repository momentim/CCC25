### Welcome to the Charleston Community Church website
We warmly extend our invitation to you to explore our brand new church website. Nestled in the heart of Charleston (we meet in what used to be the Charleston Post Office, see below), our church welcomes everyone with open arms. On our website, you'll find resources to help you connect with our diverse and loving community. Listen to our church sermons, gain insight into our beliefs, and stay up to date with the latest happenings and special events. Whether you're seeking to learn more about Jesus and the church or simply looking for a warm, inclusive community, we are here for you. Come join us online or in person and experience all that we're about - loving God and making Him known to others.
