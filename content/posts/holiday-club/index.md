### Holiday Club for Primary Age Youths - 3rd to 6th July 2023
Calling all buckaroos and cowgirls! Get ready for an action-packed journey into the Wild West at our Church Holiday Club. This year, our theme is "Wanted: Redeemed by Jesus," where we'll discover that we may be 'wanted' as criminals, but Jesus offers us redemption and a new life. Primary school-aged children are invited to join us for an exciting week filled with fun activities, games, crafts, stories, and so much more!

Gather 'round, young outlaws, as we explore the untamed frontier of the Wild West. Through captivating stories, we'll learn how Jesus seeks out and redeems each one of us, even when we may feel lost or like outlaws in need of saving. Our adventure will be filled with laughter, learning, and discovering the boundless love of Jesus.

**Uncover the Gospel Truth:**
Throughout the week, we'll dive into Bible stories that highlight how Jesus redeems even the most 'wanted' among us.
