Philippians 4:8
Who is the Master? | When We Love Ourselves More Than God

MAIN CONFERENCE 7th October

SESSION 1 | We all need Jesus (Proverbs 4:4) - Andy Prime ‘Eternal life is a relationship; to know God the father and to know Jesus the son…All our relationships need this relationship’

“…And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.”
John 17:3-5

SESSION 2 | We're all broken (James 4:1-6) – Mez McConnell 
“All our conflict starts within us”

“So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.”
Romans 7:21-23 

…But he gives more grace.
James 4:6

SESSION 3 | Fearing God (Proverbs 29:25) – Tim Rawlinson
In contrast to the fear of man, the fear of God equals a heart set free to live for the glory of God safe in the love of God.

The fear of God is a gift that comes to us through the gospel.

“The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death.”
Proverbs 14:27

SESSION 4 | Dealing with conflict (Philippians 2:1-11) – Andy Constable
“There is no way to have pride in our hearts if we have a true estimation of Christ and what he has done for us on the cross”

“For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” 2 Corinthians 5:21

SESSION 5 | Reconciliation (Philemon) – Andy Robertson
“If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.”
Romans 12:18

Can we ever be as forgiving of each other as God is of us. Our sin is finite, the mercy of God is infinite.

It’s costly to forgive but the price we pay is nothing compared to the price Jesus paid to forgive us.
