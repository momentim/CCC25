### Begins 8th November 2023 place TBD
<p>Charleston Community Church is beginning a Home Group Bible Study in November 2023. These gatherings offer a chance for us to delve deeper into God's word, gaining a greater understanding of what it truly means to be a Christian and to better comprehend the essence of God's character.</p>

On **the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of every month, from 7 to 8pm**, we come together to have a tea/coffee, prayer and work systematically through a book of the Bible to gain a richer understanding of its teachings and apply them to our lives. We plan to **begin on the 8th November 2023** and location details will be given via the church whatsapp group.

If you'd like to learn more see any of the elders, Andy, Tim or Phil. We will hold our usual church wide food prayer meeting on the 3rd Wednesday of each month at the church. This Home Group Bible Study aims to create a warm and inclusive atmosphere, where individuals of all backgrounds and levels of biblical knowledge can engage in open and respectful discussions. Whether you're already a believer or just beginning in the faith, all are welcome!
