## 💎 TREASURE COVE HOLIDAY CLUB 💎

### 🗺️ A Week of Adventure Awaits

Set sail with **Zack Smallfry**, a young sailor ready for the adventure of a lifetime! When he joins up with a band of pirates, it seems like all fun and treasure hunts... but not everything is as it seems on the high seas.

Whispers are spreading across the ocean — of a **great King of the Seven Seas** who has returned. Some say he's come for justice. Others say he's full of kindness and mercy. Zack's curiosity is stirred, and he begins to wonder: could this mysterious King be the answer to something deeper?

One thing’s for sure — this voyage will change everything.
