- **Time:** 7:00 - 8:30 PM

### 🥘 Food & Dietary Needs
We'll have plenty of delicious mild and spicy curries for everyone! If you have any dietary requirements (veggie, gluten-free, etc.), let us know via our [Contact Page](../../../../contact/#contact-form).

### 🧠 The Quiz
Expect a mix of general knowledge, random trivia, and those "I definitely knew that!" moments. The winning team gets **bragging rights for a year** and possibly a small, underwhelming prize.  

### 👥 Teams
Come as a team or show up solo — we'll happily slot you in with others. The more brains, the better!

### 💷 Cost
It's all on us. Just bring your best banter, brainpower, and appetite.

So mark your calendars and get ready for a fun night. See you there! 🥳
