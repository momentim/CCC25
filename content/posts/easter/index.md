### Good Friday and Easter Sunday Services
Good Friday and Easter Sunday carry deep significance for every follower of the Christian faith. On Good Friday, we commemorate Jesus Christ's crucifixion at Calvary, a powerful demonstration of God's ultimate love for humanity. Through Jesus' sacrifice, all sinners (every human) are offered the chance to be saved from judgment and separation from God. During our church's Good Friday service, we create a prayerful atmosphere with hymns, Bible readings, preaching, and heartfelt prayers, encouraging everyone to reflect on and express gratitude for the immense price paid for our salvation.

Easter Sunday, also known as Resurrection Sunday, is a time of immense joy and hope as we celebrate the miraculous resurrection of Jesus from the dead. This triumph over death opens the gateway to eternal life for all believers. Our Easter services are filled with jubilant praise and worship, embracing the hope and renewal that can only come from God. We extend a heartfelt invitation to all, regardless of their background or spiritual journey, to join us for our Good Friday and Easter Sunday Services and experience the transformative power of God's boundless love and grace.

These services will be held on **Good Friday the 7th of April at 7pm** and **Easter Sunday the 9th April at 10:30**.
