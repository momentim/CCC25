# Privacy Notice for Charleston Community Church (CCC)

**Last Updated:** 6th August 2023

At Charleston Community Church (CCC), we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard or "process" your personal data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws. By using our services or providing your information to CCC, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Personal information is any information, held either in paper records or electronically, from which you can be identified. Examples of personal information are your name, address, email address, telephone number, IP address, photograph, or video image. The processing of personal information is governed by data protection law. "Processing" is anything that is done with personal information, from collection onwards.

## The Information We Hold and Why We Hold It

### Contact Details and Communication
CCC holds contact details within our email service providers so that the church leadership can get in touch with you.

### Safeguarding
Both the Free Church of Scotland and CCC are legally required to keep an up-to-date record of those in our congregation who volunteer or work with children or vulnerable adults.

### Membership and Baptism
If you are a member of CCC (St. Peter's Free Church), your name and address appear on our Communicant Members Roll. This is shared with the Free Church of Scotland. If you or your child have been baptized at CCC, a record of this is also kept and may be shared with the Free Church of Scotland.

### Donations and Gift Aid
If you give to the church in a way that is not anonymous (including but not limited to by BACS, standing order, weekly envelope, cheque, or Stripe), your name and donation(s) amounts will be securely stored on our Finance Software, which is accessible to the Treasurer(s).

### Volunteers and Employees
If you serve on any of our rotas, we will also have a record of the fact that you do so, and your name will appear on the rota(s). This will be visible on Google Drive to the church leadership and anyone else who serves on a rota at CCC.

### CCTV
CCC operates CCTV surveillance of the entrance doors to the church and the main hall and lobbies for the purpose of crime prevention and public safety. Video footage is retained for 14 days.

### Events
From time to time, we run events or meals at CCC that require prior sign-up. Examples of this include but are not limited to Curry and Quiz Nights, Carol Services, etc. A record of expected attendees will be kept prior to the event to enable adequate preparation.

### Children
We keep a record of the names of the children who are in each Impact Club and Holiday Club to enable us to plan, prepare, and "staff" (with volunteers!) the relevant groups adequately.

## How We Collect Your Personal Information
CCC will collect and process data obtained via paper and electronic forms.  


**The following should also be noted with reference to the collection of data:**
- In situations where information is ambiguous or not clear, the person will be contacted and asked to re-submit a form or provide clarity via email, which will be retained as a PDF by CCC.
- CCC will not accept the submission of an adult’s personal information by another person and will only accept the details of one adult per form submission.
- Where two parents submit conflicting ‘permissions’ pertaining to their children, the lowest level of permission will apply, and the parents will be contacted for clarification.

## Security and Retention of Personal Information
We are committed to ensuring that personal information is held and retained securely and in accordance with data protection principles. More specifically, we keep data in accordance with the guidance set out in our Data Retention Policy, a copy of which is available at our website or by asking for a copy from the church office through our [Contact Page](../../../../contact/#contact-form).

CCC endeavors to remove unnecessary data as quickly as possible where we are permitted to within our legal obligations. Personal data will be deleted from our records when we are informed of a person leaving the church. Annual reviews of our data will be carried out to remove any related to persons that we have become aware have left the congregation without informing the church office.

## Your Rights
You have the right to make certain requests in relation to your personal data. You can request copies of the personal data which we hold about you by contacting the church office through our [Contact Page](../../../../contact/#contact-form). If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, please let us know so that we can have this rectified. You can request that we erase your data if there is no longer any need for us to keep it, although we may still need to retain it if the reasons why it was obtained still exist. If the only legal basis on which we hold the data is your consent, and you withdraw that consent, then we will erase your data on request.
