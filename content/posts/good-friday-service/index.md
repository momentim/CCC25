**This Good Friday, we're gathering for a communion service. But what exactly is a communion service — and why does it matter so deeply on this day?**

### A Table Set Long Ago

Before there was “communion,” there was **Passover** — the meal remembering how God rescued His people from slavery in Egypt. It was a meal that God told his people to observe filled with symbols: unleavened bread, bitter herbs, a lamb sacrificed and blood painted on doorposts so death would pass over them.

Every year, Jewish families celebrated this act of deliverance. It was around **this table**, on the night before his death, that **Jesus shared one final meal with his disciples**.

But this time, he said something new.

> “This is my body, given for you.  
> This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for many.”

Jesus fulfilled Passover — showing that **he himself would be the Lamb**, sacrificed so that death would pass over us. The bread and the cup weren’t just tradition anymore. They became personal. Costly. Intimate.

### What is Communion?

Communion is a moment where we **remember** that sacrifice. But it’s more than memory — it’s **participation**. It’s a sacred act of worship where we:

- Recognize our need for God’s rescue - that we are sinners
- Reflect on Christ’s body broken and blood shed for us    
- Respond in humble gratitude, repentance, and hope  

### Who Is Communion For?

If you **recognise that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness**, and you believe that **your only hope is in Jesus — his death in your place and his resurrection from the grave** — then we warmly invite you to take part in communion with us.

If that’s not where you are just now, we encourage you to simply observe and reflect on what it is about. Scripture warns that **“anyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner... eats and drinks judgment on themselves”** (1 Corinthians 11:27–29).
