Our minister Andy Robertson and the church elders are charged from St Peter\u0026rsquo;s to devote themselves to the people of Charleston and to share the Gospel to that community of 4,500 people.\nFurther we have partnered with 20 Schemes a church planting initiative that focuses on schemes, the most impoverished communities in Scotland. The process of church planting in Charleston involves building partnerships with local churches, recruiting indigenous church planters, gospel workers, and interns to form a dedicated team. Living within the community is a key strategy to reach the schemes. 20 Schemes focuses on evangelism, discipleship, and one-to-one Bible study, to foster healthy spiritual growth. They offer support and contextual training to church planters, aiming to empower indigenous leaders within the schemes.\nWe want Charleston Community Church to be a church made up of people from Charleston that will do four key things: REACH the lost with the gospel, TEACH people how to live obediently to Jesus, TRAIN future gospel leaders and SEND them out to other parts of Dundee and Scotland.\n-Andy Robertson\nWe are also a member of the wider Free Church of Scotland. This means that we are a Presbyterian Church, united with and supported by many other churches across Scotland and further afield, based on our common theology and beliefs.\nHowever, this does not mean that you have to be a member of the Free Church of Scotland to attend!

These avenues of support encompass Prayerful, Practical, and Financial contributions, each playing a crucial role in sustaining God\u0026rsquo;s work in Charleston.\nPrayerful Support:\nPrayer is the driving force that underpins all endeavors of the church. Believers are encouraged to lift up their voices in prayer for the church\u0026rsquo;s leaders, members, and visitors. Our Minister Andy Robertson, Rachel Baker, Gospel Worker (from 20schemes), Caireen leading Wee Rascals, Ann heading up the Senior\u0026rsquo;s Lunch, Bev and Rachel - Ladies\u0026rsquo; Bible Study Leaders, the Elders, the musicians, and numerous other church members and regular attenders that contribute to the life of the church. When people pray they actively participate in supporting our small congregation.\nUntil we are able to get the resources to write and distribute our own prayer and news letter, please feel free to subscribe to the Free Church of Scotland Prayer Notes that inform us of the local prayer needs (sent weekly to your email inbox).\nPractical Support:\nRolling up one\u0026rsquo;s sleeves to support the church\u0026rsquo;s initiatives is another impactful way to contribute. Charleston Community Church provides numerous opportunities for hands-on involvement. Mission work allows individuals to spread the message of faith through action, while assisting in organizing events such as holiday clubs in the summer. Simple acts like serving tea and coffee before services contribute to a warm and welcoming atmosphere, making visitors and members feel valued and cherished. Other ways to serve are to volunteer to read the Bible passages on Sunday, help out at the Impact club as a leader, volunteer in the crèche, operating the sound board, and most importantly welcoming visitors and usuals alike at the café and church. Matthew 20:26-28 \u0026ldquo;Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave — just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”\nFinancial Giving:\nFinancial support is much appreciated to aid the church\u0026rsquo;s ongoing activities and initiatives. Charleston Community Church gratefully welcomes any financial contributions that individuals or other churches are willing to offer. Donations can be made via cheques or electronic transfers using the provided account details: Sort Code 80-73-31, Account Number 06038175, payable to Charleston Church Plant. For those who are taxpayers in the UK, filling out this Gift Aid Form can lead to an extra 25 pence for every pound donated, maximizing the impact of one\u0026rsquo;s generosity. You can support Rachel through the 20schemes ministry.\nMany thanks for your support in any form for God\u0026rsquo;s work through Charleston Community Church!\n","date":"2 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/support-us/","section":"About Us","summary":"Prayerful and Practical Support and Financial Giving are some great ways to give to God\u0026rsquo;s work in Charleston","title":"Support Us","type":"about"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/communion/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Communion","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/good-friday/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Good Friday","type":"tags"},{"content":"This Good Friday, we're gathering for a communion service. But what exactly is a communion service — and why does it matter so deeply on this day?\nA Table Set Long Ago Before there was “communion,” there was Passover — the meal remembering how God rescued His people from slavery in Egypt. It was a meal that God told his people to observe filled with symbols: unleavened bread, bitter herbs, a lamb sacrificed and blood painted on doorposts so death would pass over them.\nEvery year, Jewish families celebrated this act of deliverance. It was around this table, on the night before his death, that Jesus shared one final meal with his disciples.\nBut this time, he said something new.\n“This is my body, given for you.\nThis cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for many.”\nJesus fulfilled Passover — showing that he himself would be the Lamb, sacrificed so that death would pass over us. The bread and the cup weren’t just tradition anymore. They became personal. Costly. Intimate.\nWhat is Communion? Communion is a moment where we remember that sacrifice. But it’s more than memory — it’s participation. It’s a sacred act of worship where we:\nRecognize our need for God’s rescue - that we are sinners Reflect on Christ’s body broken and blood shed for us Respond in humble gratitude, repentance, and hope Who Is Communion For? If you recognise that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness, and you believe that your only hope is in Jesus — his death in your place and his resurrection from the grave — then we warmly invite you to take part in communion with us.\nIf that’s not where you are just now, we encourage you to simply observe and reflect on what it is about. Scripture warns that “anyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner\u0026hellip; eats and drinks judgment on themselves” (1 Corinthians 11:27–29).\nYou’re Invited During the Good Friday Service at 7pm, we’ll read the story of Jesus’s crucifixion and respond through communion.\nFriday 18th April, 7pm\nCharleston Community Centre\n\u0026ldquo;Do this in remembrance of me.\u0026rdquo; – Jesus\nOur Easter Service will be this Sunday the 20th of April at the Community Centre at the normal time of 10:30.\n","date":"15 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/good-friday-service/","section":"Charleston Community Church News","summary":"This Good Friday, we're gathering for a communion service.

The service was especially poignant for one of the newest members, Tammy, who had recently professed faith in Christ after being connected to the church since its launch in 2017.\nOur minister, Rev. Andy Robertson, explained church membership during the service: “Church membership is not about receiving special privileges or rewards, like VIP treatment or loyalty benefits. Instead, it is a formal commitment made before God to the people of the church. It involves being dedicated to Jesus and to one another within the church community.” Andy went on to explain that baptism symbolises the death of Jesus on the cross, which forgives sin and brings people into God’s family. “In the New Testament Church, baptism is a sign that points backward to what Jesus accomplished rather than forward to something still to come. The use of water in baptism represents the cleansing of sin and the union with Jesus that all Christians experience. Baptism is a picture of God’s promise to cleanse, save, and restore us to Him, but the act of baptism itself does not save. It’s not a magic ritual; there are baptised individuals who are not saved, and non-baptised individuals who are saved. Baptism is a sign, and signs point to what truly saves, which is living, saving faith in Jesus.” Tim Allyn, an elder at Charleston, said, “It’s a testament to God’s faithfulness in building His church here in Charleston. We’ve been blessed to walk alongside these individuals as they’ve grown in their faith, and it’s a privilege to welcome them into our church family. We look forward to what God will continue to do in and through them.” Following the service, the congregation gathered for lunch to celebrate the day. The sense of community was evident as the new members, the entire church family, and friends from further afield came together to mark the occasion.\n","date":"2 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/baptisms-and-new-members/","section":"Charleston Community Church News","summary":"On the 22nd of September, Charleston Community Church welcomed eight new members, two of whom were also baptised (Iona and Stephanie)!","title":"Baptisms and New Members","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/special-services/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"special services","type":"tags"},{"content":"All S1 - S3's Welcome to the Teens Cafe!\rLooking for a place to hang out, have fun, and connect with friends after school?

The name “Good Friday” might seem paradoxical because it commemorates the suffering and death of Jesus Christ.\nHow can Christians call it “Good” when their Savior was killed?\nThe answer lies in Christ’s obedience to His Father’s will in becoming the sacrifice for mankind. Calling it “Good” reflects the belief among Christians that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice for the sins of humanity, offering the promise of reconciliation with God and securing the hope of resurrection.\nThis sacrificial act is seen as the ultimate demonstration of God’s love for humanity. It’s a day of solemn reflection and gratitude for the sacrifice Jesus made, leading to the celebration of Easter Sunday, which commemorates his resurrection and victory over death.\nCome worship with us this coming Friday 29th March at 7pm for a Good Friday service where we will look at the passage in the Bible that tells us about Jesus\u0026rsquo;s death:\nCarrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle.\nPilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews. Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”\nPilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”\nWhen the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.\n“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.”\nThis happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said,\n“They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.”\nSo this is what the soldiers did.\nNear the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Woman, here is your son,” and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.\nLater, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips. When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\n-John 19: 17-30 (New International Version)\n","date":"22 March 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/good-friday/","section":"Charleston Community Church News","summary":"Good Friday holds significant importance for Christians, marking the day Jesus Christ was crucified and died at Calvary.

We've put the videos from the conference below.\nThe schedule was:\nFRIDAY 6th Womens Pre-Conference (12-4pm) “…whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.” Philippians 4:8 Who is the Master? | When We Love Ourselves More Than God\n“If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what it right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” Genesis 4:7\nSESSION 1 | Eve, disobedience - Miriam McConnell\nSESSION 2 | Bathsheba, adultery - Lindsey Stewart\nSESSION 3 | Martha, grumbling - Fontaine Selway\nPraise Night SUNG WORSHIP led by 20schemes Music\nMAIN CONFERENCE 7th October\nSESSION 1 | We all need Jesus (Proverbs 4:4) - Andy Prime ‘Eternal life is a relationship; to know God the father and to know Jesus the son…All our relationships need this relationship’\n“…And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed.” John 17:3-5 SESSION 2 | We\u0026rsquo;re all broken (James 4:1-6) – Mez McConnell “All our conflict starts within us”\n“So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.” Romans 7:21-23\n…But he gives more grace. James 4:6 SESSION 3 | Fearing God (Proverbs 29:25) – Tim Rawlinson In contrast to the fear of man, the fear of God equals a heart set free to live for the glory of God safe in the love of God.\nThe fear of God is a gift that comes to us through the gospel.\n“The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death.” Proverbs 14:27 SESSION 4 | Dealing with conflict (Philippians 2:1-11) – Andy Constable “There is no way to have pride in our hearts if we have a true estimation of Christ and what he has done for us on the cross”\n“For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” 2 Corinthians 5:21\nSESSION 5 | Reconciliation (Philemon) – Andy Robertson “If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.” Romans 12:18\nCan we ever be as forgiving of each other as God is of us. Our sin is finite, the mercy of God is infinite.\nIt’s costly to forgive but the price we pay is nothing compared to the price Jesus paid to forgive us.

This vision is a call to faith, ministry, and mission for every believer to be a part of.\n#### Embracing Wholeness in Ministry, Mission, and Training\rAt its core, this vision seeks to nurture churches that excel in ministry, mission, and training. It envisions congregations that provide robust spiritual leadership, actively engage with their communities, and equip their members with the knowledge and skills needed for service. These churches will serve as beacons of light and hope, enriching the lives of those they touch.\nGod\u0026rsquo;s Plan for Flourishing This vision is not merely a human endeavor; it aligns with the divine plan for God\u0026rsquo;s church to flourish not just in Scotland but far beyond its borders. It embodies the belief that as we faithfully fulfill our mission, the church will grow in health and extend its impact across the globe.\nA Collaborative Mission Beyond Denomination This grand vision joins with individuals, partners, and organizations who share the commitment to spread Christ\u0026rsquo;s saving message. It\u0026rsquo;s a testament to the fact that building healthy gospel churches is a collective mission that transcends denominational boundaries.\nGod at the Heart of It All The foundation of a healthy gospel church is God Himself. It\u0026rsquo;s about coming together to worship Him, to learn from His Word, and to put into practice the teachings of the Bible. But it\u0026rsquo;s not limited to the confines of church walls—it extends into communities, ensuring that every soul hears the life-changing message of Jesus Christ.\nA Grand Plan for Church Planting A bold aspect of this vision is the plan to plant 30 new churches by 2030. These new churches will sprout in the Highlands, central belts, east coast, west coast, suburban areas, city centers, and rural regions. It\u0026rsquo;s a comprehensive vision that aims to serve the diverse needs of Scotland.\nThe Need for New Ministers and Resources To realize this ambitious goal, there\u0026rsquo;s a pressing need for 70 new ministers in the next decade. This endeavor demands resources, finances, teachers, and educational opportunities. It\u0026rsquo;s a challenge that calls for unity and dedication.\nTrue to the Bible and Relevant to Society The key to developing a healthy gospel church lies in striking a balance between faithfulness to the Bible and relevance to contemporary society. This balance ensures that the church remains rooted in its biblical heritage while effectively engaging with the challenges of the modern world.\nSharing the Gospel: A Collective Responsibility Sharing the gospel is not the exclusive responsibility of a few; it\u0026rsquo;s a collective duty. It\u0026rsquo;s about recognizing the presence of Jesus in our lives and sharing His message with those we encounter. Everyone has a role to play.\nThe Power of Prayer Prayer is the heartbeat of this vision. It acknowledges that, ultimately, it is God who grows a healthy church. Prayer is the foundation upon which this vision rests, seeking divine guidance, intervention, and transformation.\nHow Can You Get Involved? If you\u0026rsquo;re eager to be part of this transformative journey, start by praying. Seek God\u0026rsquo;s vision for your local situation. Engage in conversations within your congregation or Presbytery, exploring what it means to grow in health. Connect with the Mission Board to share your plans and discover how they can assist.\nCharleston Community Church is glad to be a part of this vision. Please join in the commitment to participate, contribute, and pray. As this vision takes root and flourishes, it promises to bring renewed vitality to Scotland\u0026rsquo;s spiritual landscape and illuminate the path to Christ for countless souls.

On Good Friday, we commemorate Jesus Christ\u0026rsquo;s crucifixion at Calvary, a powerful demonstration of God\u0026rsquo;s ultimate love for humanity. Through Jesus\u0026rsquo; sacrifice, all sinners (every human) are offered the chance to be saved from judgment and separation from God. During our church\u0026rsquo;s Good Friday service, we create a prayerful atmosphere with hymns, Bible readings, preaching, and heartfelt prayers, encouraging everyone to reflect on and express gratitude for the immense price paid for our salvation. Easter Sunday, also known as Resurrection Sunday, is a time of immense joy and hope as we celebrate the miraculous resurrection of Jesus from the dead. This triumph over death opens the gateway to eternal life for all believers. Our Easter services are filled with jubilant praise and worship, embracing the hope and renewal that can only come from God. We extend a heartfelt invitation to all, regardless of their background or spiritual journey, to join us for our Good Friday and Easter Sunday Services and experience the transformative power of God\u0026rsquo;s boundless love and grace.\nThese services will be held on Good Friday the 7th of April at 7pm and Easter Sunday the 9th April at 10:30.\n","date":"12 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/easter/","section":"Charleston Community Church News","summary":"Good Friday and Easter Sunday Services Good Friday and Easter Sunday carry deep significance for every follower of the Christian faith.","title":"Good Friday and Easter Sunday Services","type":"posts"},{"content":"Welcome to Craft and Cuppa, where creativity meets community!

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” - Matthew 11:28-30 Here are some practical ways to understand what it means to become a Christian:\nIt all starts with God: God lovingly made the entire world and we once lived in perfect harmony with Him. But we rebelled against Him and each of us has the inclination to commit harmful deeds against both God and our fellow mankind (See Genesis 1 - 3 in the Bible). This is known as sin and it separates us from God. Our greatest need as humans is to be restored to the perfect harmonious relationship that we once had with our maker - God. That\u0026rsquo;s why we need a Christ, a Messiah, a saviour from our brokenness and misery. And Christians derive their name from being followers of Jesus the Christ. Learn About Christianity: Begin learning about what it means to be a follower of Christ. You can read the Bible, which is the Word of God, and explore resources that explain the core concepts of the faith. Join a Christianity Explored Course either as a group or we\u0026rsquo;d be happy to run one for you individually. Come visit us informally at our café, one of our Bible Studies or attend our Sunday Services (you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a Christian in order to attend). Some other helpful resources are The Bible Project, our online sermons, and Solas - Short Answers\nBelieve in Jesus Christ: Central to Christianity is the belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Saviour of humanity. Accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour is a fundamental step. This involves acknowledging your need for forgiveness and salvation and recognizing that Jesus\u0026rsquo; death and resurrection offer that forgiveness and eternal life.\nRepentance: Repentance is the sincere turning away from sinful (sin is wrong things we do that offends God and separates us from him, often hurting us and other people) behavior and a commitment to live a new life according to Christian principles. It involves acknowledging your mistakes and seeking God\u0026rsquo;s forgiveness. No one is going to be able to live a sinless life but the Good News that Jesus cleanses us from our sins is the driving force for Christians to live righteous (God honouring) lives.\nPrayer: Begin praying to God. This is a way to communicate with Him, share your thoughts, ask for guidance, and express your desire to become a Christian.\nAcceptance of Grace: Christianity teaches that salvation is a gift of God\u0026rsquo;s grace, not something that can be earned through doing good deeds. Accept this gift by faith, trusting in God\u0026rsquo;s love and mercy.\nConfession of Faith: Publicly confess your faith in Jesus Christ, that he lived, died and rose again from the dead, thus proving that he has power over death and the ability to save us. This can happen privately or in a church setting, where you might share your decision with a pastor or congregation.\nBaptism: Baptism is a significant symbolic act in Christianity. It represents a person\u0026rsquo;s spiritual rebirth and identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. While the timing and mode of baptism can vary among Christian denominations, it\u0026rsquo;s an important step for believers.\nGrowth and Discipleship: After becoming a Christian, continue to learn and grow in your faith. Read the Bible regularly, pray, connect with other believers, and seek spiritual mentorship to deepen your understanding of Christianity. Joining a Bible study group is a great way to learn more about the Bible and grow in community with other Christians.\nChurch Community: It is essential to join a local Christian church. Being part of a church provides support, fellowship, and opportunities to worship, learn, and serve together with other believers.\nLive According to Christian Principles: As a Christian, strive to live a life that aligns with the teachings of Jesus Christ. This involves showing love, compassion, forgiveness, and kindness to others and actively seeking to live out your faith in your daily life. Continually remember that our good deeds can\u0026rsquo;t save us, but we do good deeds because of the great gift that we have received in Jesus Christ.\n","date":"1 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/becoming-a-christian/","section":"Charleston Community Church News","summary":"“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
