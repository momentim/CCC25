### Recovery Group Bible Study
Experience a life-changing opportunity with Crossroads, our bible study group dedicated to individuals fighting drug addiction. **We meet regularly at the Church on Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:30.** Through immersing ourselves in God's word, we help you find true transformation, break free from addiction's chains and experience real satisfaction in life.
